Python text message automator for Mac iOS that puts each message into Messages for review and send. Useful if you have a large number of pre-written messages to send to a list of phone numbers, but want to keep each one human-sent with one click of a button. You will have to select Send as Text Message when it fails to send for non-iPhone users.
